<h1>Who Can Play</h1>


    <p>
    There are 800 million players worldwide who play volleyball at least once a week. </p>
    <p>Volleyball is a sport that is safe, fun and does not require extreme fitness.<br> Since you don’t have to move around the court too much, it’s great for people who want a low-impact sport that will        help them get fit without pushing them to their limit.</p>

    <p> For those who are a bit more competitive, the sport is fantastic because games can be really exciting and intense, but there’s always a net between you and your opponents.<br>
    Beach volleyball is suitable for people of all ages, and men and women alike.</p>
    <p>Anyone considering starting a new sport or exercise program should see their doctor first.
